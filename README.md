Clustering Algorithms:

Clustering algorithms are unsupervised learning methods used to group similar data points together based on certain criteria, often aiming to maximize intra-group similarity and inter-group dissimilarity. These algorithms partition data into clusters, making it easier to understand the inherent structure within the data. Various clustering algorithms exist, each with its own approach and suitability for different types of data and structures.

K-Means:

K-Means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm. It partitions a dataset into K clusters, where each cluster is represented by its centroid (center point). The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and recalculates centroids until convergence, aiming to minimize the sum of squared distances (variance) within each cluster. K-Means is sensitive to the number of clusters specified (K) and works best on datasets with well-defined, spherical clusters.

Hierarchical Clustering:

Hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchy of clusters by either iteratively merging data points or dividing clusters based on proximity. It can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down). In agglomerative hierarchical clustering, each data point starts as a single cluster and progressively merges into larger clusters based on similarity until a single cluster encompasses all points. Divisive clustering starts with all data points in one cluster and divides them based on dissimilarity until each data point is in its cluster. Hierarchical clustering generates a dendrogram, a tree-like structure illustrating cluster relationships at various levels of similarity.

DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm:

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm. It groups points based on their density and identifies clusters as areas of high density separated by regions of low density. Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN doesn't require the number of clusters as an input and is capable of identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes. It distinguishes core points (high-density points), border points (near core points), and noise/outlier points, making it effective in handling datasets with varying densities and shapes.

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):

Gaussian Mixture Models represent a probabilistic model for clustering. They assume that the dataset is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions (clusters). GMMs estimate the parameters (mean and covariance) of these Gaussian distributions and assign probabilities of data points belonging to each distribution/cluster. Unlike K-Means, GMM allows for soft clustering, where data points have probabilities of belonging to multiple clusters rather than a strict assignment. GMMs are capable of identifying clusters with varying shapes and sizes and are more flexible in handling complex data distributions.
